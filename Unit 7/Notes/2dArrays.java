   2-D arrays are arrays that have both rows and columns.
    -A row has horizontal elements.
    -A column has vertical elements
    
   2D arrays are useful when the data is naturally organized in rows and columns like in a
   spreadsheet, bingo, battleship, etc.
   
   Java stores 2D arrays as arrays of arrays. Each element of the outer array has a reference to
   each inner array.
   ROW MAJOR ORDER
   When you talk about a specific element in an array, you list the row first and then the column.
   
   int [][] scores = new int [num rows][num cols];
   int [][] scores = {{57, 50, 2}, {40, 70, 35}};
   
   In order to traverse 2D arrays, you have to use nested loops.
   
   for (int row=0; row<array.length; row++){
      for (int col=0; col<array[0].length; col++){
         System.out.println (array[row][col]);
      }
   }
