   A class is like a blueprint for the objects inside it
   A class defines the attributes and the methods for objects of that class

   Example:
   Class - Human Beings
   Attributes: Hair color, eye color, height, width, weight
   Methods: Drive, breathe, speak, walk, eat
   
   Objects are created inside of classes, and every object has the attributes and methods that the class has.
   
   Not only does the class tell us about the attributes and the behaviors of the objects, but it also tells us how to assign those attributes and behaviors to each object created.
   This is done using the method called THE CONSTRUCTOR.
   Constructors are used to create and initialize objects.
   
   Constructors always have the same name as the class and are used after the keyword "new".
   You can have multiple constructors defined in a class.
     -This is called overloading the constructor.
     
   className objectName = new Constructor(arguments);
   Even if there is no arguments, you still have to put the parentheses ()
   
   Void methods will not return anything to you, but they will execute commands.
         imagine (), sleep (), think ()
   Non-Void methods will execute commands and return a value to you that can be used later.
         talking (), answering ()
         
    Parameters/Arguments are values you can give (or pass) to the methods to help them do their job.
    Not all methods require parameters, but if they do, and you do not provide them, that method will not be able to do its job and will give you feedback.
    
    Using methods is the same as calling methods.
         You can call methods on different objects to have the object to do what you want.
    objectName.method(arguments);
    
    EX: msTopper.calculateRectangleArea(7, 9);
    
    An object is an instance of a class.
